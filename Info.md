This is still in progress and not even early access! The developers are still workin on it so just look what will come up :D

#what is planed?
It is going to be a console game on Windows and Linux.
The point of this game is that it shouldn't feel like a game, more like a real-adventure with the ghoul to save your pc and help a lost man.
But let us start from the beginning. When you starte the game, a console will show up, a short loading screen and an AI called "Ikarus" will say hello.
This AI is going to give you some easy challanges like use the encrypting module. But after a few test's the things are going to be stange:
an endless loading screen, corrupted messages and lot's of stuff more. Now you're job is it to fix this shit and save your PC.

Have a nice time, Ikarus
